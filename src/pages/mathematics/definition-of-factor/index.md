## Definition of Factor

A factor can be defined in 2 ways. The first is in multiplication. Take _3 * 4 = 12_. Here _3_ and _4_ are factors, and together they make a product. Another way a factor can be defined is if the remainder upon division equals 0. Take the number 12. If we divide 12 by 4 
  _12 / 4 = 3_ 
The remainder is 0. There are no decimal spaces, and therefore 4 is _a factor of_ 12. Likewise, if we do
  _12 / 3 = 4_
we also get a remainder of 0. Therefore both 3 and 4 are factors of 12.

We can simplify this and use _%_ as the modulo function. This will give us
  _12 % 3 = 0_
Because the modulo function returns the remainder upon division, any number that returns 0 upon the use of modulo is a factor of the other number.
